\arguments{
\item{sampleTable}{A data frame with the sample information to be passed to qsea.}

\item{BSgenome}{A BSgenome string. See BSgenome::available.genomes() for options.}

\item{chrSelect}{Which chromosomes to use (default 1:22).}

\item{windowSize}{What window size (in bp) to use in the genome (default 300).}

\item{CNVwindowSize}{What window size (in bp) to use in the calculation of CNV (default 1000000).}

\item{fragmentType}{What type of procedure generated the library, Sheared or cfDNA (used to set the average fragment length/SD to a default for CBC)}

\item{fragmentLength}{Average DNA fragment length. Can be set by fragmentType.}

\item{fragmentSD}{Standard deviation of the DNA fragment lengths. Can be set by fragmentType.}

\item{CNVmethod}{Which method to use for calculation of CNV. Options include "HMMdefault" (hmmcopy with default parameters) and "None".}

\item{coverageMethod}{Whether to use custom method for reading coverage in (set to PairedAndR1s), rather than qsea's (qseaPaired).}

\item{minMapQual}{Minimum MAPQ score for a read to be kept. For coverageMethod = "PairedAndR1s", will keep if either R1 or R2 meet this cutoff in a properly paired read (if MQ tags are set in the bam file with samtools fixmate).}

\item{minInsertSize}{For paired reads, only keep them if they are above a minimum length. Only applies to coverageMethod = "PairedAndR1s", and applies to Input samples as well as MeCap.}

\item{maxInsertSize}{For paired reads, only keep them if they are below a maximum length. Only applies to coverageMethod = "PairedAndR1s", and applies to Input samples as well as MeCap.}

\item{minReferenceLength}{A minimum distance on the genome to keep the read. bwa by default gives 19bp as minimum for a read, which is quite short. Only applies to coverageMethod = "PairedAndR1s", and applies to Input samples as well as MeCap.}

\item{badRegions}{A GRanges object containing regions to filter out from the result.}

\item{properPairsOnly}{Whether to only keep properly paired reads, or to keep high-quality (MAPQ 30+) unpaired R1s as well. Set to TRUE for size selection. Only applies to coverageMethod = "PairedAndR1s", and applies to Input samples as well as MeCap.}

\item{hmmCopyGC}{A data frame containing GC content per bin (each with size \code{CNVwindowSize}), only for use with hmmcopy.}

\item{hmmCopyMap}{A data frame containing Mapability content per bin (each with size \code{CNVwindowSize}), only for use with hmmcopy.}

\item{parallel}{Whether to read in files by using each core in parallel. Control number of calls by calling e.g. BiocParallel::register(BiocParallel::MulticoreParam(4)) beforehand.}
}
\value{
A qseaSet object, containing all the information required.
}
\description{
This function makes the initial qseaSet from a sampleTable that includes the file paths for the bam files and their metadata.
