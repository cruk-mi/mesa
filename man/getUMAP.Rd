\usage{
getUMAP(
  qseaSet,
  dataTable = NULL,
  regionsToOverlap = NULL,
  normMethod = "beta",
  minEnrichment = 3,
  useGroupMeans = FALSE,
  minDensity = 0,
  topVarNum = 1000,
  topVarSamples = NULL,
  returnDataTable = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{qseaSet}{A qseaSet object.}

\item{dataTable}{A data frame of normalised values for a set of windows (rows) and samples (columns), e.g. from \code{\link[=getDataTable]{getDataTable()}}. It must have seqnames, start and end columns. Can also be a \code{\link[GenomicRanges:GRanges-class]{GenomicRanges::GRanges()}} object with normalised values in the metadata columns.}

\item{regionsToOverlap}{Optional. Only windows in \code{qseaSet} overlapping \code{regionsToOverlap} will be considered. A \code{\link[GenomicRanges:GRanges-class]{GenomicRanges::GRanges()}} object or a data frame which can be coerced into a \code{\link[GenomicRanges:GRanges-class]{GenomicRanges::GRanges()}} object.}

\item{normMethod}{What normalisation method to use. Typically a character giving name of predefined normalisation method (e.g. "beta" or "nrpm"). See \code{\link[qsea:normMethod]{qsea::normMethod()}}.}

\item{minEnrichment}{Minimum number of reads for beta values to not give NA. Passed to \code{\link[=getDataTable]{getDataTable()}}.}

\item{useGroupMeans}{Whether to average samples over the group column (i.e. combine replicates)}

\item{minDensity}{A minimum CpG density level to filter out windows with values lower than.}

\item{topVarNum}{Number of most variable windows to keep. Defaults to 1000. If value is NA, NULL, Inf or is at least as big as the available number of windows, then all available windows are used for the UMAP. Can also be a vector, in which case UMAP is performed for each component.}

\item{topVarSamples}{Samples to use to determine variability. Either NULL or NA (use all samples; default), a character vector of sample names or a regular expression to match sample names on. Can also be a list, in which case UMAP is performed for each list component. If \code{length(topVarNum) > 1}, list should be same length as \code{topVarNum} and each component will be matched with corresponding component of \code{topVarNum}.}

\item{returnDataTable}{A logical value indicating if the table of normalised values (generated by \code{\link[=getDataTable]{getDataTable()}} or by processing the input \code{dataTable}) should be returned as part of the output. See below for details.}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass to \code{\link[uwot:umap]{uwot::umap()}}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{res}{A named list where each componenet is a matrix of coordinates. List names correspond to entries in the \code{params$topVar} component of the output.}
\item{samples}{Names of the samples analysed.}
\item{windows}{A list of names of the windows analysed. List names correspond to entries in the \code{params$topVar} component of the output.}
\item{dataTable}{If \code{returnDataTable = TRUE}, the table of normalised values. The table will contain windows after filtering based on \code{regionsToOverlap} and \code{minDensity}, but prior to filtering based on \code{topVarNum}. Windows with missing values will also have been removed. The table will also include column(s) of window standard deviations, where applicable, with column name(s) corresponding to entries in the \code{params$topVar} component of the output.}
\item{params}{A list of the parameters used.}
\item{windowFiltering}{A list of the initial number of windows and the number filtered out at each filtering step (not including filtering based on \code{topVarNum}).}
