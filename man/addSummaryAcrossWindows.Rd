\arguments{
\item{qseaSet}{The qseaSet object.}

\item{regionsToOverlap}{A GRanges object (or data frame coercible to one) containing the windows to summarise over. If missing, will use all the regions in the qseaSet.}

\item{fn}{A function to apply across the windows. e.g. mean, median, sd.}

\item{suffix}{A suffix for adding to the new columns of data, to clarify where the regions came from for instance.}

\item{normMethod}{One or more normalisation methods to use, e.g. "nrpm" or "beta" or c("nrpm", "beta").}

\item{naMethod}{What method to use to deal with NA values (for beta values). Options are "drop" or "impute".}

\item{minEnrichment}{For beta values only, the minimum number of reads required for a window to be fully methylated, qsea replaces with NA below this value.}
