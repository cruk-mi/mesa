\arguments{
\item{qseaSet}{The qseaSet object.}

\item{sample1}{First sample name, from which to take proportion of samples}

\item{sample2}{Second sample name}

\item{sample3}{Third sample name}

\item{nReadsTotal}{Number of reads in total to have after mixing}

\item{proportion1}{The proportion to take from sample1}

\item{proportion2}{The proportion to take from sample2}

\item{newName}{A name to give the new sample}

\item{groupName}{A name to use in the group column in the sampleTable}

\item{onlyNew}{Whether to only return the new sample.}

\item{renormalise}{Whether to renormalise the result. Speeds up the process when you are repeatedly subsampling, only need to do it once at the end.}
